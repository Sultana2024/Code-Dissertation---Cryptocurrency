This file includes all the code files from the LSTM model development phase. 
From 1-4, the baseline regression model was built and tuned using BTC dataset. 
The final LSTM models for each cryptocurrency are 5-8. 

1. BTC Baseline LSTM (Garcia)
2. BTC Classification LSTM (first trial)
3. BTC Optuna LSTM 
4. BTC Gridsearch LSTM 
5. BTC Optimised LSTM (regression)
6. LTC Optimised LSTM (regression)
7. ETH Optimised LSTM (regression)
8. XRP Optimised LSTM (regression)
